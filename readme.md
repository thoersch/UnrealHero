# UnrealHero - Music Game Proof of Concept
A proof of concept of a music game that generates notes at a specified tempo where the player must match the specified notes to the timing of the visual cues.

## Basics
Each note is a bitmask of 16 possible note combinations and each note generated (based on tempo) is randomized. As the note passes closer to the bottom of the screen, the notes will quickly illuminate green to showing when to play the corresponding note.  Notes can be held at any time, but should only be played (strummed) when the note crosses the timing marker and the note becomes green.

Correct notes award points and who doesn't want points!?
